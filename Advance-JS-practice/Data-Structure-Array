Data Structures:
1. Arrays.  5. Trees
2. Stacks.  6. Tries
3. Queues.  7. Graphs
4. Linked Lists  8. Hash Tables

Algorithms:
1. Sorting.
2. Dynamic Programming.
3. BFS + DFS (Searching)
4. Recursion

Arrays:
Organizing items sequentially one after and memory.
Least amount of rules.
Store data one by one and smallest foot print in any data structure.


Array Operation:
lookup O(1)  // Access
push O(1)   
insert O(n) 
delete O(n)

Why use Array?
Fast lookups        Slow inserts 
Fast push/pop       Slow deletes
Ordered             Fixed Size
                     if using static array
