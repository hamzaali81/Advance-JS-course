Linked-List:
1. Singly  (One node one block) 
2. Doubly  (One node Two blocks)

What problem aof arrays ?
1. Static fixed limit.
2. Certain limit.

Arrays performe bad performance specially performance.
List then Link

Why linked-List better than hash and arrays ?

A linked list sort of loose structure that allows you to insert a value into the 
middle of the list.

The main difference between arrays and linked lists is that in an array
an element or element are indexed.

In linked add item in a traversal.
The traversal is same as iteration that we did with as erase.
e.g while loop.

Most computer have cache system.
Link list and nodes instead are actually scattered all over memory.

traversal is quite a bit slower than iterating through items like an array
even through they are technically both of an. 

Hash Tables:
Insert 


Linked-List
prepend O(1)  (begging)
append O(1)    (last)
lookup(traversal) O(n)     (Look item) 
insert O(n)     (Insert item) worst case
delete O(n)     worst case

What is pointer ?
Pointer is simpler reference to another place in memory.

Doubly LinkedList:
Doubly linked list is similar except thai it links to the node before it.
They points both each other.

One node two block
e.g [1,2]

head             Tail            Next 
1                  2             Null
Point tail        Points head


Down side: hold more memory.
